# ToolKart E-commerce

ToolKart is a demo full-stack e-commerce experience built with a vanilla HTML/CSS/JS frontend and an Express + MongoDB backend. The project is organised into two workspaces:

- `frontend/` contains static pages, shared assets, and lightweight scripts that consume the backend APIs. Pages are designed to mirror the provided ToolKart mockups (Home, Shop, About, Contact, Cart, Login, Admin, etc.).
- `backend/` exposes RESTful endpoints for authentication, products, cart, and admin dashboards. It follows a light MVC layout using Express, Mongoose, and JSON Web Tokens. Demo data ships in-memory with optional MongoDB seeding via `.env` configuration.
